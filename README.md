### Arknights Damage Calculator
This passionate project was made by someone who is bad at math but loves gaming and programming. 
Initially I thought of naming it Babel Calculator. Written fully using `Python` and using `Tkinter` as GUI 
# Beware :
- This project is my first program after learning the basics of `Python`. I thought about making an Arknights DPS calculator and to accomplich that I learned `Tkinter`.

- I think my work contain a lot of comments and mistakes that you could `As Programmer` learn from.

- I used Tkinter with `Azure-Theme` from `https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme` @rdbende


# What Arknights Damage Calculator has?
- Physical Damage Calculator
- Art Damage Calcultor

# Why making it ? don't we already have `viktorlab` ?
- First, I don't know Chiness and google translation didn't help much. 
- Second, I love Arknights and I suck at math but I love Programming.
- Third, it's to test what I learned from my collage 
- Lastly and most important It's fun !
# Why there is no main menu to go to each feature ? 
Because to accomplice that I need to learn how `Classes` work on Python. So I just delayed until my friend learn basics of python then do this project again with him !

# Who am I currently ?
